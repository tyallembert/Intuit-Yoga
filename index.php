        <p>Molly’s vision is to offer to others the calm centering that yoga has given her. “I want to provide opportunities for renewal, equanimity and spontaneous joy that yoga has given to me through the years,” she shared. She is particularly interested in supporting fellow teachers seeking to refill their wells.</p>
